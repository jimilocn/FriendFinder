# FriendFinder


This program was created in the Northwestern University Coding Bootcamp 2019. It a matching application that pulls forth people from a database and gives you the best match based on survey questions. This program challenges the coder to utilize the express applications to access information and url routing to navigate between pages. The coder was also challenged to dip their toes into full stack developing for the first time. The coder must access information from the server side and also log in information from the client side to pull forth the proper results.


## Friend Finder road map for the page

Once the client accesses the page, the landing page gives a brief description of the goal of the site, and then the client is guided towards a survey page. The client will then enter their name, a URL link to a picture of them, and asked to rank 10 questions.  If there is anything left blank, the user will be prompted to complete the survey to find a match.

Once the proper information is sent tot he server, there will be a double loop cycling through the array of answers sent from the client and compare it to the answers from the people listed in the server's database. The resulting person with the lowest difference in scores from the survey will be the best match, and that person is displayed with a modal. The client is prompted to go to the match's instagram or go back to the home screen!
